# Pokémon-Companion

## Description
As a group we choose to build this web application to meet the acceptance criteria below. 
This application uses the PokéAPI to populate our page with information regarding the searched Pokémon's attacks, sprite, ability description, and any evolutions if applicable.

We also used the Youtube API to mini music player add some music while the user searches for Pokémon. This feature allows the user to pause, mute or toggle volume on the player.

We decided to style this web application using Bootstrap and CSS.
